# FEWD Week #7 Project: Responsive Design

### Description

Relaxr's user count has grown, and the number of users accessing the site from a mobile device has surprised everyone, even by today's standards. The product managers at Relaxr have asked you to return to the project and make their site responsive so it renders nicely on mobile devices. They had one of their internal developers make a few tweaks to your source code, and they have given you the new HTML / CSS files to work from but they're slightly broken. Using these starter files, finish up out the mobile layouts for the landing page and blog.
