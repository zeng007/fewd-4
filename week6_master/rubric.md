# FEWD Week #6: Working with Arrays

### Description

The team from CitiPix has reached out for iteration on their prototype. Instead of using a user's text input to change the background of the interface, the CitiPix user experience designers have asked to see how a drop-down menu would work in place of an input field. The product managers are hopeful it will also lead to less error handling for their engineers and data team. Use what you've learned this week about data-types and arrays to add on top of your work from last week. Be sure to start out with pseudocode.

| Make a new folder `js` with a new file `index.js` to match our existing HTML script tag                   | | | |
| Create an array with the following values: "NYC", "SF", "LA", "ATX", "SYD"                                | | | |
| Loop through that array on page load and use $.append() to add `<option>` elements to the `<select>`      | | | |
| Use the `$.change` event handler on the `<select>` element to capture user actions                        | | | |
| When the user changes the input of the drop-down, get the value of the `<select>` by using `$.val()`      | | | |
| Use `if / else if / else ` conditionals to control the flow of your application                           | | | |
